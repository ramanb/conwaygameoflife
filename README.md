A Scala and Swing (with Scala bindings) based solution for Conway Game of Life.


The rules for the game are outlined in "ConwayGameOfLife.scala".
* Press "Start" to start the game.
* Press "Stop" to pause the game.
* Press "Terminate" to exit the game (and the UI).

Gotchas:
1) No unit tests ... ???
2) No optimisation has been done of the game.. this is my first foray into Scala.

To run:
1) Import into Eclipse as an existing workspace - Helios seems to work
2) Run as a Scala application

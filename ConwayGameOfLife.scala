/**
 * The cellular automation known as ï»¿Conway's Game of Life is a good example of how a few simple rules can produce interesting patterns.
 *  The Game of Life is a two dimensional world consisting of cells arranged in rows and columns, where each cell has exactly 8 neighbours.
 *  A cell can either be alive ( on ) or dead ( off ).
 *
 *  Starting from some initial configuration of the world, the cells evolve based on the following:
 *   a cell is born if it has exactly 3 alive neighbouring cells,
 *   a cell continues to live if it subsequently has 2 or 3 alive neighbouring cells,
 *   a cell dies from loneliness if it has less than 2, or from over congestion if it has more than 3, alive neighbouring cells
 *
 * For this puzzle, assume that the edges of the world are joined together so that the world wraps around;
 *  for example, in a 10x10 world, the neighbours of the cell at (x,y) == (0,0) are (9,1), (0,1), (1,1), (9,0), (1,0), (9,9), (0,9), (1,9).
 *
 * To get a feel for it, start by writing a Game of Life simulator that displays the generations of cells on the screen.
 * Use any size for the world you think is appropriate, a random world for the initial configuration,
 *  and an appropriate tool that helps display the results (e.g. Java2D for Java and Scala; HTML for JavaScript; PyGame for Python; etc).
 *
 * Now for the challenge. ConSIDEr a world of size MxM, and a simulation that runs for N generations.
 *  For a simple, straightforward implementation, the program completes the simulation in T seconds.
 *  Now improve your algorithm such that the simulation finishes in less than half the time (T/2 seconds), or if you are really confident,
 *  in less than a quarter of the time (T/4 seconds).
 *  For this part, you do not have to display the results on the screen (otherwise you might be limited by your graphics library).
 *
 * To ensure a consistent initial configuration, use the following to initialize the world:
 *
 * cells along the horizontal axis (y == 0) are on
 * cells along the vertical axis (x == 0) are on
 * cells along the diagonal (x == y) are on
 * all other cells are off
 * Different environments and programming languages will execute at different speeds,
 *  so use your own judgement when deciding on the size of the world and the number of iterations to generate.
 *  As an example, a simple C++ implementation using a 1000x1000 world running for 1000 iterations runs in around 50 seconds on my machine.
 *  An improved algorithm runs in 12 seconds.
 *
 * Implementation note:
 * How do we speed this up ?
 * 1) Use multiple threads to process a segment of the cube.
 * The tricky bit is working out the neighbors in the case of wrapping with segments.
 * A 2D space broken into 4 segments (quarters) will require information from other segments.
 * Can we have 4 threads work on the same workspace .. this may mean contention issues when writing,
 * Ideally you pass start and end coordinates to each thread to do the processing.
